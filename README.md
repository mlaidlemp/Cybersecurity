UNSW-NB15 Cybersecurity Attack Classification with Machine Learning

### Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying cybersecurity attacks using the UNSW-NB15 dataset. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, we aim to build a model that can accurately distinguish between normal and malicious network traffic.

### Goal & Motivation
With the increasing number of cyber threats, automated intrusion detection systems (IDS) play a crucial role in cybersecurity. The goal of this project is to develop a high-performance classification model that can detect network attacks efficiently.
By leveraging Random Forest and XGBoost, this model provides:
- Accurate detection of cyber threats in network traffic
- Scalable machine learning solutions for real-world cybersecurity applications
- A foundation for integrating AI-driven security solutions in organizations



### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the UNSW-NB15 dataset, which contains realistic network traffic data with labeled attack categories. The dataset includes various features such as packet attributes, connection details, and protocol information, making it a valuable resource for intrusion detection research:
